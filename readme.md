    - PHP >=5.6.4
    - Composer (https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
    
Run the command to install Laravel
    -  composer global require "laravel/installer"

Download/clone the repo.

If you have PHP installed locally and you would like to use PHP's built-in development 
server to serve your application, you may use the serve Artisan command. This command

The command -- php artisan serve
